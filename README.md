### Project Name

Cook From What You Have: Your AI Kitchen Assistant for Chinese Recipes

### ðŸš€ Deployment

We deployed our agent to an Amazon EC2 instance, making it accessible via:

**ðŸ”— [http://3.19.22.54](http://3.19.22.54)**

The backend runs on `Flask`, and the server listens on port `5000`. To access the web interface:

1. Open your browser.
2. Navigate to the public IP: **http://3.19.22.54**
3. Explore the features: upload a grocery photo, speak to the assistant, or ask for recipes.

### Description

**Cook From What You Have** is an **AI-powered recipe recommendation agent** that helps users discover authentic Chinese dishes based on ingredients they already have. By simply uploading a photo of their groceries or a shopping receipt, users receive customized recipe suggestions, missing ingredient lists, and smart substitutesâ€”bridging daily cooking with intelligent assistance. 

Our agent is targeted at **home cooks, students, and busy individuals** who want to make the most of their available ingredients while reducing food waste and enjoying culturally authentic meals.

#### Features

1. **Visual Ingredient Input**: Users can upload a **photo of ingredients** or **shopping receipt**.

2. **Recipe Recommendation**: The agent uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to suggest **Chinese recipes** based on detected ingredients. It also provides: 

   - A list of **missing ingredients**, and
   - A list of **possible substitutions**.

   In PFD parsing section, it offers paddleOCR and a sliding window approach for effective document parsing. To enhance retrieval, we combined Dense (M3E) and Sparse (BGE-M3) strategies with Faiss, BM25, and BGE-Reranker, achieving Q&A accuracy improvements of over 9% compared to GPT-4 with external knowledge.

3. **Voice Interaction**: Users can **speak their ingredients or ask relevant cooking questions**. The agent supports **speech-to-text and text-to-speech** via **Azure Whisper**, enabling a hands-free, conversational experience.

4. **Cooking Video & Smart Grocery Suggestions**: Our agent can recognize user's intention and interest in a recipe, then fetches **relevant YouTube videos** using the **YouTube Data API** to provide visual step-by-step cooking guidance and recommends **nearby grocery stores** where you can buy missing items.

#### How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fredjpl/Chopsticks-Dreams.git
cd Chopsticks-Dreams
```
```bash
conda create --name chef_agent
conda activate chef_agent

# install python deps
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
```bash
# export your openai api key first
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-â€¦"
# Google map api

```
## Program launch
```bash
python -m server.server
```

#### Innovation

While there are existing recipe search tools such as *[Supercook](https://www.supercook.com/#/desktop)*, they typically require manual ingredient selection through a clunky UI, and users have reported unreliable recipe results. Some AI-based apps generate recipes, but they often lack grounding in real ingredients. 

Our agent stands out by combining **multimodal input (CV + voice)**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** with **GPT-o4-mini**, and **localized grocery recommendations** into a seamless user workflow. To our knowledge, this is the first agent that offers a **context-aware, Chinese-cuisine-focused cooking assistant** based on real-world inputs like receipts or ingredient photos.

#### **Practical Value & Scalability**

This agent is highly practical for students, busy professionals, or families who want to cook efficiently while minimizing food waste. This agent can easily be extended beyond Chinese cuisine to other culinary traditions, and integrated into smart kitchen devices or meal planning apps. Organizations such as meal-kit services or grocery platforms could incorporate this system to personalize recommendations based on what users actually have, demonstrating a wide range of commercial applications.

#### Acknowledgement

- The recipe dataset used in our RAG system is sourced from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Anduin2017/HowToCook), which provides a comprehensive collection of Chinese recipes in structured Markdown format.
- We also reviewed user feedback on existing tools such as *[Supercook](https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/l8ru1z/am_i_misusing_supercook/)* to better understand common pain points and inform the design of a more user-friendly and reliable alternative.
