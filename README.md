## Features

   - A list of **missing ingredients**, and
   - A list of **possible substitutions**.

   In PFD parsing section, it offers paddleOCR and a sliding window approach for effective document parsing. To enhance retrieval, we combined Dense (M3E) and Sparse (BGE-M3) strategies with Faiss, BM25, and BGE-Reranker, achieving Q&A accuracy improvements of over 9% compared to GPT-4 with external knowledge.

3. **Voice Interaction**: Users can **speak their ingredients or ask relevant cooking questions**. The agent supports **speech-to-text and text-to-speech** via **Azure Whisper**, enabling a hands-free, conversational experience.

## Innovation

While there are existing recipe search tools such as *[Supercook](https://www.supercook.com/#/desktop)*, they typically require manual ingredient selection through a clunky UI, and users have reported unreliable recipe results. Some AI-based apps generate recipes, but they often lack grounding in real ingredients. 

Our agent stands out by combining **multimodal input (CV + voice)**, **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** with **GPT-o4-mini**, and **localized grocery recommendations** into a seamless user workflow. To our knowledge, this is the first agent that offers a **context-aware, Chinese-cuisine-focused cooking assistant** based on real-world inputs like receipts or ingredient photos.

## **Practical Value & Scalability**

This agent is highly practical for students, busy professionals, or families who want to cook efficiently while minimizing food waste. This agent can easily be extended beyond Chinese cuisine to other culinary traditions, and integrated into smart kitchen devices or meal planning apps. Organizations such as meal-kit services or grocery platforms could incorporate this system to personalize recommendations based on what users actually have, demonstrating a wide range of commercial applications.

## Acknowledgement

- The recipe dataset used in our RAG system is sourced from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Anduin2017/HowToCook), which provides a comprehensive collection of Chinese recipes in structured Markdown format.
- We also reviewed user feedback on existing tools such as *[Supercook](https://www.reddit.com/r/cookingforbeginners/comments/l8ru1z/am_i_misusing_supercook/)* to better understand common pain points and inform the design of a more user-friendly and reliable alternative.
